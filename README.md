# Scripts
To help me and my colleagues in our work for Cloudian

[change_limits.sh](https://github.com/gstefanov-cloudian/scripts/blob/master/change_limits.sh) is an interactive script that can be used to update the `number of open files` and `NPROC` limits on our systems.

[manage_services.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gstefanov-cloudian/scripts/main/manage_services.sh) can be used to start, stop, restart and check status of HyperStore services in specified order. 

[wget-script.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gstefanov-cloudian/scripts/main/wget-script.sh) is useful for downloading a list of log files that were manually uploaded to Cloudian S3.
